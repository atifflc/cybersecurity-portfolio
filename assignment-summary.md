3. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** - Error reporting

## Incident Analysis Summary

### The Problem:
- **Website:** www.yummyrecipesforme.com inaccessible
- **Error:** "destination port unreachable"
- **Root Cause:** DNS service failure on port 53
- **Impact:** Complete service disruption for customers

### Technical Details:
- **DNS Server:** 203.0.113.2
- **Client IP:** 192.51.100.15
- **Protocol:** UDP on port 53
- **Error Response:** ICMP "udp port 53 unreachable"
- **Timestamp:** 13:24:32.192571

### Analysis Process:
1. **Customer Reports** â†’ Website inaccessible
2. **Analyst Verification** â†’ Confirmed using tcpdump
3. **Traffic Analysis** â†’ DNS queries failing
4. **Root Cause Analysis** â†’ DNS service down
5. **Solution Planning** â†’ Service restart and monitoring

## Assignment Answers

### Question 1: Summary of tcpdump log analysis
**Answer:** The tcpdump log reveals a DNS service disruption where UDP queries to port 53 on DNS server 203.0.113.2 are failing, resulting in ICMP "udp port 53 unreachable" error messages. The analysis shows multiple retry attempts with consistent failures, indicating the DNS service is not listening on the required port.

### Question 2: Root cause analysis
**Answer:** The suspected root cause is a DNS service failure on server 203.0.113.2. The service daemon has likely crashed or stopped, preventing it from listening on UDP port 53. This prevents domain name resolution for www.yummyrecipesforme.com, causing the website to be inaccessible to users.
